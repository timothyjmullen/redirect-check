## Redirect Check
Redirect Check Chrome Extension

This extension was specifically designed for HTML email UAT, but should work fine on any HTML page. It will show you a list of URLs pulled from the active tab and runs a redirect and URL syntax validation check on those selected. It also includes an option to open all URLs in a new window.

The most current stable release can be installed in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-check/cibpemjiajilcpecpimbpbgmoebcojej?authuser=1).
